20/05/2023;We had a meeting about choosing a shape. We did some usertests and 1 shape was prased very highly. Shapes needed to be ranked based on a emotion they evoked. Negative emotions were minus points, positive emotions were plus points. Now the shape is defined;4;2;Choosing a shape;Analyzing;#eea638;5
